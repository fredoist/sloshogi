web-based shogi application
This is a shogi server that I designed and coded while learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, php, and sql.
You can try it out at sloshogi.com

The code is a bit of a mess, and might cause a real developer to shudder just looking at it, but I learned a lot in the process of writing it.
